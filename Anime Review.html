  <p style="color:white;">Sword Art Online was one of the first animes that I watched and will forever have a specila place in my heart. 
  Despite many anime fans disliking this show, I personally loved it and gave it a 10/10 for a number of reasons, especially because I loved the storyline and how it played out.
  However the second part of season 2 wasn't as good as the others in my opinion, this is just because I didn't really enjoy the story for that part but that is just personal opinion.
  So far Sword Art Online has 3 animated seasons, with a film coming out later this year (2021) about Asuna's experience in Aincrad (first season).
  The announcemment trailer for this is on the left. <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/sword-art-online" target="_blank">Watch Sword Art Online on Crunchyroll.</a>
SPOILERS AHEAD! 
 </p> 
 <h4 style="color:white;">Season 1: Aincrad and Alfheim Online</h4>
 <p style="color:white;">On November 6 2022 10,000 players were trapped in a Virtual Reality Massively Multiplayer Online (VRMMO) game with no exit option, their only way out: clear all 100 floors on the floating castle. 
The missing exit button wasnt the only thing keeping them trapped, should the Nerve Gear be removed outside the VR world, then the player will die in real life. If a player dies in-game then they also die in real life.
Beta tester 'Kirito' is amongst the first people to clear a floor, and it was at this time he met 'Asuna' and these two would eventually go on to kill the Game Master (GM) and free all surviving players.
After escaping Sword Art Online, Kirito sets out to find Asuna in the real world but is instead finds out she has been trapped in yet another game. To free Asuna Kirito wears the nerve gear once more and with the help of his sister 'Leafa' finds and sets free his wife.
 </p>
 <br>
 <h4 style="color:white;">Season 2: Gun Gale Online and Alfheim Online</h4>
 <p style="color:white;"> Kirito's help is needed by a government funded organisation when a veteran Sword Art Online player appears in Gun Gale Online and claims that they can kill someone in the real world through the game.
 Trying to set up his character Kirito is helped by a sniper-specialist called 'Sinon' who helps him track down the killer. When they eventually find this killer it is revealed that it is one of Sinon's friends from school and another accomplice.
 The second part of this season focuses on Asuna helping a team of patients not likely to survive their treatment in their dreams to be the first to complete the new floor that is being released in Alfheim Online.
 There is also a smaller part inbetween where Kirito, Asuna and Klein's group travels underneath the world tree to restore the land to its former self.
 </p>
 <h4 style="color:white;">Season 3: Alicization</h4>
 <p style="color:white;">Kirito has been taking part in the before mentioned gorvenment funded team and when he has been attacked he is put into the virtual word called 'The Underworld' where he meets Eugeo and learns the laws of the world.
 The two then set of to defeat 'Administraor' to free Eugeo's childhood friend ALICE from her powers. Although successful Eugeo is killed and Kirito's soul had been damaged, causing him to be paralysed.
 After this they realise they have created true artificial inteligence through the virtual world, they succeed in doing this and when the United States government find this out, they hire a team in secret to go and retrieve ALICE.
 The team however are not successful even after trying to get her from inside The Underworld as Asuna and the others come to help The Underwold's people from being destroyed by the dark forces, led by 'Emporer Vector' or Gabriel Miller in real life.

  <p style="color:white;">Citrus is a romance anime between two step sisters and is not liked by many anime fans for a number of reasons, the main being the theme of sexual assualt in each episode although it never goes to far.
 I personally really enjoyed this anime and would reccomend watching it if you are interested but if things easily trigger/offend you then perhaps look at the trigger warnings somewhere else as there are quite a few.
 It starts off with Yuzu's mum moving in with her boyfriend and this mean Yuzu has to move schools, however the chosen one is an all-girls school and immediately upon entering she is warned by the student council president Mei that she is not properly equiped to enter the school.
 To her surprise it is later revealed that this student is her new step sister and however wrong she thinks it is, ends up falling for her. Overall this anime got a 10/10 because I enjoyed the story and animation. The trailer for this is on the left, but no season 2 has been confirmed yet.

  <h4 style="color:white;">Season 1</h4>
  <p style="color:white;">New student Yuzu has moved to an all girls school where she has developed what she thinks is love for the student council president who is also her new step sister!
  Yuzu had tried to forget and accept that it was wrong to love your sister but when Mei kissed her she went back into a state of confusion. Many people do not want the two to get together throughout this season but in the end they do and they are both happy.
